# Movie API
This app uses IMDB's REST API to retrieve the plot of a tv show or movie, as well as the main cast.

## Prerequisites

## Examples

### Search
We run the program and see the first window pop up. Let's choose 'Spider-Man' as the title for the movie and add 2012 as the year.

We will then hit the Search button and watch the API return the plot and the list of actors.

### What you'll need to run the code:

* Internet connection

* Visual Studios 2012 v 11.0
